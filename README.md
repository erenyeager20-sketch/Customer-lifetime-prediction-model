# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the lifetime value (LTV) of customers based on their purchase behavior using machine learning. It helps in targeted marketing by segmenting customers into Low, Medium, and High LTV groups.

## Files
- `Customer_LTV_Prediction.ipynb`: Complete notebook with data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `transactions.csv`: Sample transaction data.
- `ltv_predictions.csv`: Predicted LTV and customer segments.
- `ltv_model.pkl`: Saved trained regression model.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How to Run
